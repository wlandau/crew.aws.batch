\arguments{
\item{name}{Character string, name of the launcher. If the name is
\code{NULL}, then a name is automatically generated when the launcher starts.}

\item{workers}{Maximum number of workers to run concurrently
when auto-scaling, excluding task retries and manual calls to \code{launch()}.
Special workers allocated for task retries
do not count towards this limit, so the number of workers running at a
given time may exceed this maximum.
A smaller number of workers may run if the number of executing tasks
is smaller than the supplied value of the \code{workers} argument.}

\item{host}{IP address of the \code{mirai} client to send and receive tasks.
If \code{NULL}, the host defaults to \code{nanonext::ip_addr()[1]}.}

\item{port}{TCP port to listen for the workers. If \code{NULL},
then an available ephemeral port is automatically chosen.
Controllers running simultaneously on the same computer
(as in a controller group) must not share the same TCP port.}

\item{tls}{A TLS configuration object from \code{\link[crew:crew_tls]{crew_tls()}}.}

\item{tls_enable}{Deprecated on 2023-09-15 in version 0.4.1.
Use argument \code{tls} instead.}

\item{tls_config}{Deprecated on 2023-09-15 in version 0.4.1.
Use argument \code{tls} instead.}

\item{serialization}{Either \code{NULL} (default) or an object produced by
\code{\link[mirai:serial_config]{mirai::serial_config()}} to control the serialization
of data sent to workers. This can help with either more efficient
data transfers or to preserve attributes of otherwise
non-exportable objects (such as \code{torch} tensors or \code{arrow} tables).
See \code{?mirai::serial_config} for details.}

\item{seconds_interval}{Number of seconds between
polling intervals waiting for certain internal
synchronous operations to complete. In certain cases, exponential
backoff is used with this argument passed to \code{seconds_max}
in a \code{\link[crew:crew_throttle]{crew_throttle()}} object.}

\item{seconds_timeout}{Number of seconds until timing
out while waiting for certain synchronous operations to complete,
such as checking \code{mirai::status()}.}

\item{seconds_launch}{Seconds of startup time to allow.
A worker is unconditionally assumed to be alive
from the moment of its launch until \code{seconds_launch} seconds later.
After \code{seconds_launch} seconds, the worker is only
considered alive if it is actively connected to its assign websocket.}

\item{seconds_idle}{Maximum number of seconds that a worker can idle
since the completion of the last task. If exceeded, the worker exits.
But the timer does not launch until \code{tasks_timers} tasks
have completed.
See the \code{idletime} argument of \code{mirai::daemon()}. \code{crew} does not
excel with perfectly transient workers because it does not micromanage
the assignment of tasks to workers, so please allow enough idle
time for a new worker to be delegated a new task.}

\item{seconds_wall}{Soft wall time in seconds.
The timer does not launch until \code{tasks_timers} tasks
have completed.
See the \code{walltime} argument of \code{mirai::daemon()}.}

\item{retry_tasks}{Deprecated on 2025-01-13 (\code{crew} version 0.10.2.9002).}

\item{tasks_max}{Maximum number of tasks that a worker will do before
exiting. Also determines how often the controller auto-scales.
See the Auto-scaling section for details.}

\item{tasks_timers}{Number of tasks to do before activating
the timers for \code{seconds_idle} and \code{seconds_wall}.
See the \code{timerstart} argument of \code{mirai::daemon()}.}

\item{reset_globals}{\code{TRUE} to reset global environment
variables between tasks, \code{FALSE} to leave them alone.}

\item{reset_packages}{\code{TRUE} to detach any packages loaded during
a task (runs between each task), \code{FALSE} to leave packages alone.
In either case, the namespaces are not detached.}

\item{reset_options}{\code{TRUE} to reset global options to their original
state between each task, \code{FALSE} otherwise. It is recommended to
only set \code{reset_options = TRUE} if \code{reset_packages} is also \code{TRUE}
because packages sometimes rely on options they set at loading time.
for this and other reasons, \code{reset_options} only resets options
that were nonempty at the beginning of the task.
If your task sets an entirely new option not already in \code{options()},
then \code{reset_options = TRUE} does not delete the option.}

\item{garbage_collection}{\code{TRUE} to run garbage collection after each task
task, \code{FALSE} to skip.}

\item{crashes_error}{Deprecated on 2025-01-13 (\code{crew} version 0.10.2.9002).}

\item{processes}{Deprecated on 2025-08-27 (\code{crew} version 1.2.1.9009).}

\item{r_arguments}{Optional character vector of command line arguments
to pass to \code{Rscript} (non-Windows) or \code{Rscript.exe} (Windows)
when starting a worker. Example:
\code{r_arguments = c("--vanilla", "--max-connections=32")}.}

\item{crashes_max}{In rare cases, a worker may exit unexpectedly
before it completes its current task. If this happens, \code{pop()}
returns a status of \code{"crash"} instead of \code{"error"} for the task.
The controller does not automatically retry the task, but
you can retry it manually by calling \code{push()} again and using the same
task name as before. (However, \code{targets} pipelines running \code{crew}
do automatically retry tasks whose workers crashed.)

\code{crashes_max} is a non-negative integer, and it sets the maximum number of
allowable consecutive crashes for a given task.
If a task's worker crashes more than \code{crashes_max} times in a row,
then \code{pop()} throws an error when it tries to return the results
of the task.}

\item{backup}{An optional \code{crew} controller object, or \code{NULL} to omit.
If supplied, the \code{backup} controller runs any pushed tasks that have
already reached \code{crashes_max} consecutive crashes.
Using \code{backup}, you can create
a chain of controllers with different levels of resources
(such as worker memory and CPUs) so that a task that fails on
one controller can retry using incrementally more powerful workers.
All controllers in a backup chain should be part of the same
controller group (see \code{\link[crew:crew_controller_group]{crew_controller_group()}}) so you can call the
group-level \code{pop()} and \code{collect()} methods to make sure you get results
regardless of which controller actually ended up running the task.

Limitations of \code{backup}:
* \code{crashes_max} needs to be positive in order for \code{backup} to be used.
Otherwise, every task would always skip the current controller and
go to \code{backup}.
* \code{backup} cannot be a controller group. It must be an ordinary
controller.}

\item{options_metrics}{Either \code{NULL} to opt out of resource metric logging
for workers, or an object from \code{\link[crew:crew_options_metrics]{crew_options_metrics()}} to enable
and configure resource metric logging for workers.
For resource logging to run,
the \code{autometric} R package version 0.1.0 or higher
must be installed.}

\item{options_aws_batch}{List of options from \code{\link[=crew_options_aws_batch]{crew_options_aws_batch()}}.
The job definition and job queue must be specified in
\code{\link[=crew_options_aws_batch]{crew_options_aws_batch()}}. \code{\link[=crew_options_aws_batch]{crew_options_aws_batch()}} also allows
you to request vCPUs, GPUs, and memory for the jobs.}

Use \code{options_aws_batch} instead.}

Use \code{options_aws_batch} instead.}

\description{
Create an \code{R6} object to submit tasks and
launch workers on AWS Batch workers.
}
\section{IAM policies}{

In order for the AWS Batch \code{crew} plugin to function properly, your IAM
policy needs permission to perform the \code{SubmitJob} and \code{TerminateJob}
AWS Batch API calls. For more information on AWS policies and permissions,
please visit
\url{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html}.
}

\section{AWS arguments}{

The AWS Batch controller and launcher accept many arguments
which start with \code{"aws_batch_"}. These arguments are AWS-Batch-specific
parameters forwarded directly to the \code{submit_job()} method for
the Batch client in the \code{paws.compute} R package

For a full description
of each argument, including its meaning and format, please visit
\url{https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/batch_submit_job/}. The upstream API
documentation is at
\url{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_SubmitJob.html}
and the analogous CLI documentation is at
\url{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/batch/submit-job.html}.

The actual argument names may vary slightly, depending
on which : for example, the \code{aws_batch_job_definition} argument of
the \code{crew} AWS Batch launcher/controller corresponds to the
\code{jobDefinition} argument of the web API and
\code{paws.compute::batch()$submit_job()}, and both correspond to the
\code{--job-definition} argument of the CLI.
}

\section{Verbosity}{

Control verbosity with the \code{paws.log_level} global option in R.
Set to 0 for minimum verbosity and 3 for maximum verbosity.

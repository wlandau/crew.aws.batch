Package: crew.aws.batch
Title: A Crew Launcher Plugin for AWS Batch
Description: In computationally demanding analysis projects,
  statisticians and data scientists asynchronously
  deploy long-running tasks to distributed systems,
  ranging from traditional clusters to cloud services.
  The 'crew.aws.batch' package extends the 'mirai'-powered
  'crew' package with a worker launcher plugin for AWS Batch.
  Inspiration also comes from packages 'mirai' by Gao (2023)

  and 'batchtools' by Lang, Bischl, and Surmann (2017).

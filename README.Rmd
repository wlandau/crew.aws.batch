In computationally demanding analysis projects, statisticians and data scientists asynchronously deploy long-running tasks to distributed systems, ranging from traditional clusters to cloud services. The `crew.aws.batch` package extends the [`mirai`](https://github.com/shikokuchuo/mirai)-powered 'crew' package with a worker launcher plugin for [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/). Inspiration also comes from packages [`mirai`](https://github.com/shikokuchuo/mirai), [`future`](https://future.futureverse.org/), [`rrq`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/rrq/), [`clustermq`](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/), and [`batchtools`](https://mllg.github.io/batchtools/).

# Documentation

Please see <https://wlandau.github.io/crew.aws.batch/> for documentation, including a full function reference and usage tutorial.

# Prerequisites

`crew.aws.batch` launches [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/) jobs to run [`crew`](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/) workers. This comes with a set of special requirements:

1. Understand [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/) and its [official documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/).
2. Your [job definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/job_definitions.html) must each have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)-compatible container image with R and `crew.aws.batch` installed. You may wish to inherit from an existing [rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2) image.
3. At minimum, for the launcher plugin to work, your [IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) need permission to [submit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_SubmitJob.html) and [terminate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_TerminateJob.html) jobs. To appropriately monitor jobs, your policies also need permission to [list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_ListJobs.html) and [describe](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeJobs.html) jobs. In addition, managing job definitions as described below requires permission to [register](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterJobDefinition.html), [deregister](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_DeregisterJobDefinition.html), and [describe](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeJobDefinitions.html) job definitions. To view [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) logs, you need permission to [get log events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_GetLogEvents.html).
4. In the [compute environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html), the [security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-groups.html) must permit all inbound and outbound TCP traffic within itself.^[If you already know the TCP port you will supply to `port` argument of `crew_controller_aws_batch()`, you can restrict the port range to only use that port number.] The controller and the workers must run in this security group so they can communicate within the firewalled local network.^[Please read about the [risks](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/articles/risks.html) and keep TLS encryption turned on (default: `tls = crew_tls(mode = "automatic")`). Please understand and comply with all the security policies of your organization.] If your security group ID is `sg-00000` and belongs to [VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) `vpc-00000`, then your inbound and outbound rules may look something like this:

```

# Managing job definitions

Before submitting jobs, AWS Batch requires a job definition to describe the container image and resource requirements. You can do this through the AWS web console, the AWS command line interface (CLI), a software development kit (SDK) like the `paws` R package, or the job definition class in `crew.aws.batch`. For `crew.aws.batch`, first create a job definition object.

```r
definition <- crew_definition_aws_batch(
  job_definition = "YOUR_JOB_DEFINITION_NAME",
  job_queue = "YOUR_JOB_QUEUE_NAME"
)
```

The job definition may or may not exist at this point. If it does not exist, you can register with `register()`, an oversimplified limited-scope method which creates container-based job definitions with the `"awslogs"` log driver (for CloudWatch).^[The log group supplied to `crew_monitor_aws_batch()` must be valid. The default is `"/aws/batch/log"`, which may not exist if your system administrator has a custom logging policy.] Below, your container image can be as simple as a Docker Hub identifier (like `"alpine:latest:`) or a full URI of an ECR image.^[For the `crew` controller, you will definitely want an image with R and `crew` installed. For the purposes of testing the monitor, `"alpine:latest"` will work.]

```{r}
definition$register(
  image = "AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME:IMAGE_TAG",
  platform_capabilities = "EC2",
  memory_units = "gigabytes",
  memory = 8,
  cpus = 2
)
#> # A tibble: 1 × 3
#>   name                     revision arn                                     
#>   <chr>                       <int> <chr>                                   
#> 1 YOUR_JOB_DEFINITION_NAME       81 arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:CENSORED:jo…
```

The `describe()` method shows information about current and past revisions of the job definition. Set `active` to `TRUE` to see just the active revisions.


```{r}
definition$describe(active = TRUE)
#> # A tibble: 2 × 16
#>   name            arn   revision status type  scheduling_priority parameters
#>   <chr>           <chr>    <int> <chr>  <chr>               <dbl> <list>    
#> 1 YOUR_JOB_DEFIN… arn:…       82 active cont…                   3 <list [0]>
#> 2 YOUR_JOB_DEFIN… arn:…       81 active cont…                   3 <list [0]>
#> # ℹ 9 more variables: retry_strategy <list>, container_properties <list>,
#> #   timeout <list>, node_properties <list>, tags <list>,
#> #   propagate_tags <lgl>, platform_capabilities <chr>,
#> #   eks_properties <list>, container_orchestration_type <chr>
```

Use `deregister()` to deregister a revision of a job definition. If a revision number is not supplied, then it defaults to the greatest active revision number.

```{r}
definition$deregister()
#> # A tibble: 1 × 16
#>   name            arn   revision status type  scheduling_priority parameters
#>   <chr>           <chr>    <int> <chr>  <chr>               <dbl> <list>    
#> 1 YOUR_JOB_DEFIN… arn:…       81 active cont…                   3 <list [0]>
#> # ℹ 9 more variables: retry_strategy <list>, container_properties <list>,
#> #   timeout <list>, node_properties <list>, tags <list>,
#> #   propagate_tags <lgl>, platform_capabilities <chr>,
#> #   eks_properties <list>, container_orchestration_type <chr>
```

# Monitoring and terminating jobs

With `crew.aws.batch`, your `crew` controller automatically submits jobs to AWS Batch. These jobs may fail or linger for any number of reasons, which could impede work and increase costs. So before you use `crew_controller_aws_batch()`, please learn how to monitor and terminate AWS Batch jobs manually.

`crew_monitor_aws_batch()` defines a "monitor" to help you manually list, inspect, and terminate jobs. You will need to supply a job definition name and a job queue name.

```{r}
monitor <- crew_monitor_aws_batch(
  job_definition = "YOUR_JOB_DEFINITION_NAME",
  job_queue = "YOUR_JOB_QUEUE_NAME"
)
```

You can submit individual AWS Batch jobs to test your computing environment.

```{r}
job1 <- monitor$submit(name = "job1", command = c("echo", "hello\nworld"))
job2 <- monitor$submit(name = "job2", command = c("echo", "job\nsubmitted"))
job2
#> # A tibble: 1 × 3
#>   name  id                                   arn                       
#>   <chr> <chr>                                <chr>                     
#> 1 job2  c38d55ad-4a86-4371-9994-6ea8882f5726 arn:aws:batch:us-east-2:0…
```

Method `status()` checks the status of an individual job.

```{r}
monitor$status(id = job2$id)
#> # A tibble: 1 × 8
#>   name  id                arn   status   reason created started stopped
#>   <chr> <chr>             <chr> <chr>    <chr>    <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>
#> 1 job2  c38d55ad-4a86-43… arn:… runnable NA     1.70e12      NA      NA
```

The `jobs()` method gets the status of all the jobs within the job queue and job definition you originally supplied to `crew_monitor_aws_batch()`. This may include many more jobs than the ones you submitted during the life cycle of the current `monitor` object.

```{r}
monitor$jobs()
#> # A tibble: 2 × 8
#>   name  id                arn   status    reason created started stopped
#>   <chr> <chr>             <chr> <chr>     <chr>    <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>
#> 1 job1  653df636-ac74-43… arn:… succeeded Essen… 1.70e12 1.70e12 1.70e12
#> 2 job2  c38d55ad-4a86-43… arn:… runnable  NA     1.70e12      NA      NA
```

The [job state](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/job_states.html) can be `"submitted"`, `"pending"`, `"runnable"`, `"starting"`, `"running"`, `"succeeded"`, or `"failed"`. The monitor has a method for each job state to get only the jobs with that state.

```{r}
monitor$succeeded()
#> # A tibble: 1 × 8
#>   name  id                arn   status    reason created started stopped
#>   <chr> <chr>             <chr> <chr>     <chr>    <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>
#> 1 job1  653df636-ac74-43… arn:… succeeded NA     1.70e12 1.70e12 1.70e12
```

In addition, there is an `active()` method for just states `"submitted"`, `"pending"`, `"runnable"`, `"starting"`, and `"running"`, and there is an `inactive()` method for just the `"succeeded"` and `"failed"` states.

```{r}
monitor$inactive()
#> # A tibble: 1 × 8
#>   name  id                arn   status    reason created started stopped
#>   <chr> <chr>             <chr> <chr>     <chr>    <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>
#> 1 job1  653df636-ac74-43… arn:… succeeded NA     1.70e12 1.70e12 1.70e12
```

To terminate a job, use the `terminate()` method. This has the effect of both canceling and terminating the job, although you may not see the change right away if the job is currently `"runnable"`. Manually terminated jobs are listed as failed.

```{r}
monitor$terminate(id = job2$id)
```

To get the CloudWatch logs of a job, use the `log()` method. This method returns a `tibble` with the log messages and numeric timestamps.

```{r}
log <- monitor$log(id = job1$id)
log
#> # A tibble: 2 × 3
#>   message     timestamp ingestion_time
#>   <chr>           <dbl>          <dbl>
#> 1 hello   1702068378163  1702068378245
#> 2 world   1702068378163  1702068378245
```

If the log messages are too long to conveniently view in the `tibble`, you can print them to your screen with `cat()` or `writeLines()`.

```{r}
writeLines(log$message)
#> hello
#> world
```

# Using `crew` with AWS Batch workers

To start using `crew.aws.batch` in earnest, first create a controller object. Also supply the names of your job queue and job definition, as well as any optional flags and settings you may need. If you do not already have a job definition, the "monitor" object above can help you create one (see above).

```{r}
library(crew.aws.batch)
controller <- crew_controller_aws_batch(
  name = "my_workflow", # for informative job names
  workers = 16,
  tasks_max = 2, # to avoid reaching wall time limits (if any exist)
  seconds_launch = 600, # to allow a 10-minute startup window
  seconds_idle = 60, # to release resources when they are not needed
  processes = NULL, # See the "Asynchronous worker management" section below.
  options_aws_batch = crew_options_aws_batch(
    job_definition = "YOUR_JOB_DEFINITION_NAME",
    job_queue = "YOUR_JOB_QUEUE_NAME",
    cpus = 2,
    gpus = 0,
    memory = 4,
    memory_units = "gigabytes"
  )
  
)
controller$start()
```

At this point, usage is exactly the same as basic [`crew`](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/). The `push()` method submits tasks and auto-scales [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/) workers to meet demand.

```{r}
controller$push(name = "do work", command = do_work())
```

The `pop()` method retrieves available tasks.

```{r}
controller$pop()
#> # A tibble: 1 × 11
#>   name         command result seconds   seed error trace warni…¹ launc…² worker insta…³
#>   <chr>        <chr>   <list>   <dbl>  <int> <chr> <chr> <chr>   <chr>    <int> <chr>  
#> 1 do work   … do_work… <int>        0 1.56e8 NA    NA    NA      79e71c…      1 7686b2…
#> # … with abbreviated variable names ¹​warnings, ²​launcher, ³​instance
```

Remember to terminate the controller when you are done.

```{r}
controller$terminate()
```

# Asynchronous worker management

HTTP requests to submit and terminate jobs may take up to 1 or 2 seconds, and this overhead may be burdensome if there are many workers. To run these requests asynchronously, set the `processes` argument of `crew_controller_aws_batch()` to the number of local `mirai` daemons you want to process the requests. These processes will start on `controller$start()` and end on `controller$terminate()` or when your local R session ends. `controller$launcher$async$errors()` shows the most recent error messages generated on launch or termination for all workers.

# Troubleshooting

`processes = NULL` disables async and makes launch/termination errors immediate and easier to see. You may also wish to set `options(paws.log_level = 3L)` to increase the verbosity of `paws` messages.
